# Pervasive Enterprise Information Portal

## Overview

One of the largest Mutual Fund Organization in India needed to come up with an Enterprise Information Portal(EIP) for its employees and partners located in its 400+ offices and Investor Service Centres spread all over India with a sizeable percentage of employees who are constantly on the move.

Without such a portal, coordination, distribution of regulatory mandates, process sharing and dissemination of knowledge was becoming increasingly challenging.
